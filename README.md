# Spectrum
Spectrum is a Windows App that is meant to communicate with Arduino Boards to control NeoPixels.
***
It is currently not fully functional I will update this Readme when I make the app functional.

At this point in time the app will require the included Arduino code in order to work properly but I have plans in the future to be compadable will your own arduino code. You can of course modify the program or the arduino code to fit your needs and I have done my best to make this program intuitive to use and modify.
