## NOTE FROM DEAN
Sorry about the lack of updates recently school has been taking up most of my time and I have not had time to work on the code for this for a few months.

After going back to the code I realized how terribly I wrote everything and I have decided to rewrite the entire program from the ground up. I am doing this to push the program into its first Beta (named Spectrum 0.5) and make future development easier. The goal of Spectrum 0.5 is to greatly improve the codebase to be more userfriendly and efficient, since I used poor programming techniques which led to bad code and lots of repition. I am estimating this will take me at least 2 months to complete so please be patient with the lack of updates durring that time. I do understand that there are a few bugs in the program and I will not be fixing those since most they reside deep in the codebase and it would take away time that I could be working on in this large update. I plan on adding a lot of new features (which I will disscuss at a later date) and rewriting many of the old ones.

In the mean time any bug reports are greatly appreciated and you can follow the development at the [Road Map](https://github.com/DeanSellas/Spectrum/projects/5), or [Spectrum 0.5 Branch](https://github.com/DeanSellas/Spectrum/)

# Spectrum
Spectrum is a Windows App that is meant to communicate with Arduino Boards to control NeoPixels.

[Official Website](http://deansellas.com/spectrum/)
***

At this point in time the app will require the included Arduino code in order to work properly but I have plans in the future to be compatible will your own Arduino code. The code and this program are being made fully modifiable so you can change any part of it to suite your needs.

Documentation is comming very soon, so you can start customizing the app to your needs!
