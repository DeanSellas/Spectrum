# Spectrum
Spectrum is a Windows App that is meant to communicate with Arduino Boards to control NeoPixels.
***

At this point in time the app will require the included Arduino code in order to work properly but I have plans in the future to be compatible will your own Arduino code. The code and this program are being made fully modifiable so you can change any part of it to suite your needs.
